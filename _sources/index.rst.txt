**Cogitare** is a Modern, Fast, and Modular Deep Learning and Machine Learning
framework in Python. A friendly interface for beginners and a powerful toolset
for experts.

It uses the best of `PyTorch <http://pytorch.org/>`_, `Dask
<https://dask.pydata.org/>`_, `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, and others
tools through a simple interface to train, to evaluate, to test
models and more with high performance.

With Cogitare, you can use classical machine learning algorithms with high
performance and develop state-of-the-art models quickly.

We have a collection of tutorials online, some of them ported from
http://pytorch.org/tutorials/ to work with Cogitare.
